# Designing an ideal user experience

Now that your users are set up and organized in Workfront, how do you build an experience for them that's so delightful, they not only use it, they LIKE using it?

Adoption of a work management solution like Workfront has many facets, but one of the most foundational is to create an experience that is thoughtfully designed for how your users work. If they see it as a bottleneck, or as 'just another tool' you'll hit hurdle after hurdle with adoption.

In this on-demand webinar, we'll cover:

* How to better understand what your users need 
* Tips to optimize your user's experience using layout templates, dashboards, and pins 
* Example System Admin request queues and user management dashboards 
* How Liberty Mutual used the new Workfront experience roll-out to dramatically increase adoption.
