# Understanding user management

In order for people to do or access certain things in Workfront, they need to be setup correctly. This involves their license and their access levels. Once your users are in Workfront, you also need to consider how they'll be organized into groups and teams.  

In this on-demand webinar, Mary Ann Erickson, Sr. Customer Success Manager at Adobe Workfront, and Heather Kulbacki, Marketing Systems Specialist (and Workfront Guru) at Thermo Fisher Scientific, will cover:

* The basics of licenses, access levels, groups and teams 
* Object hierarchy and sharing permissions
* Recommended practices we've learned from others just like you  
* How Thermo Fisher Scientific, a leading supplier of scientific instrumentation, reagents and consumables, and software services, chose to organize their users and lessons they've learned along the way
